	<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">MERLIN</h1>
	<h5 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">a.k.a the C*ck Wizard</h5>
	<img src="Merlin02.png" alt="Broken Mage">
	<p>Ah yes, what a good way to start the day with a good ol' d*ckening. In this page, we feature one of most broken~~
	I mean "balanced" support in the game known as Merlin, or what most players call him the "D*ck Mage" or the "C*ck Wizard"
	because of lore reasons, and later you might understand why even a good Servant like him can be sorely hated by everyone
	in the game.</p>
	<p>Starting off, Merlin is basically designed to specialize and excel at supporting Buster Servants. Needless to say, he is
	currently [and most certainly will be] the only Support Servant who's the strongest of his niche. The thing that makes him
	broken is not only his ability to support Buster Servants, but also his flexibility to fit literally any team comp imagineable.
	Generally speaking, Buster team comps are designed to deal heavy damage only for a short amount of time; meaning, they only
	take at most three (3) turns for them to deal damage, and after that they become completely useless. Because of C*ck Wizard, everyone
	gets free c*cks; he can offer literally anything a Servant would want to have.</p>
	<h2>Strengths</h2>
	<ul style="list-style-image:url('GreenPlus.jpg')">
		<li><p><b>Plethora of utility</b>: Merlin excels at two things: sustain and tons of damage. In terms of sustain, his NP gives Health, NP Charge,
		and Crit Stars per turn, aiding both offensive and defensive sides of any team comp. His skills are straighforward to use, yet flexible for anyone.
		You might argue that his 3rd skill can only be used for Buster Servants, but it can also be used for other creative ways because his 3rd skill's
		Max Health increase also works as a pseudo-heal; simply put, it isn't affected by heath regen debuffs, and when it expires it simply returns your
		max health back to normal without affecting your current health pool. Adding his 2nd skill, and you basically have a 7-turn-cooldown "LOL Nope"
		button you can press on any tight situation (not that you also use it for Crit Star Gen anyway). To be fair, that's the only hard defense Merlin
		has with a very long cooldown. Not only does Merlin fit on Buster teams, he also fits on Arts teams very well due to his deck having majorly Arts
		cards including his NP, effectively making him work on Arts loop teams and Stall teams <b style="font-size:90%">(now you see how broken his ass is?)
		</b>.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>One-turn Damage Support</b>: Merlin's damage buffs are most effective on the very turn the buffs were cast on. His 3rd skill offers
		a Crit Damage buff for 1 turn, so imagine a Buster Servant making a Buster Brave Chain and all of them surely dealing crit damage. Knowing that buffs
		stack multiplicatively, a single Merlin can offer at most 250% of bonus damage to a single target, and if you add another Support Merlin in the works,
		then that's a lot of damage! #NoPunIntended</p></li>
